================communicate with github================
0)cd <development folder>
1)
If git repo already exist in local:
    a)cd ./<folder> 
    b)git fetch origin development # a local branch 'development' will be created

If git repo not exist in local:
    a)git clone <url of repository>
    b)cd ./<folder>

2)do things locally...(edit, add, commit, etc.)
3)git push origin <local branch>:<remote branch> # e.g. temp:development, development:development (abbrev. development)

================edit git================
git branch            # view all branch
git branch temp       # create branch temp
git checkout temp     # switch working branch (to temp)

# now you can add, edit, delete files!!!!
# after you have done your edit,...

git add my_file       # staging my_file, do this each by each! Use '--all' can quickly do staging, but not recommended
git status            # see files waiting for commit
git commit -m "my comment for this commit!"

# git rebase development   # obtain development current status to temp, only when worrying someone would affect the development branch after branching out temp
git checkout development   # switch back working branch to development
git merge temp              
git branch -d temp         # delete branch temp

================git GUI================
gitk &                # '&' can create a new thread, such that the console window is still responsive.
